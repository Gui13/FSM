/*
 The idea behind this API is to have a prettier and faster way to describe a FSM. 
 As of today, FSM basically consist
 - either of a double dimension table which size is (Nb of states) * (Nb of event).
 handler_cb table[i][k]={
            event1     event2      event3
 stateX	{   handler1,   NULL,       NULL},
 stateY	{   handler2,   handler3,   NULL}
 };
 This maximizes the handling time of a particular {event, state} sequence, since 
 accessing an element of this table is simply a matter of table[event][state].
 - or a table that describes the state machine as a list of event/state/handler:
 {STATE_X, EVENT1, handler_1},
 {STATE_Y, EVENT1, handler_2},
 {STATE_Y, EVENT2, handler_3}
 This method is prettier and easier to read, but slow to handle, since you have 
 to walk the table to handle an event.
 
 Here, I try to merge the two behaviors: 
    - you define a "pretty" table that describes your state machine,
    - you use this API to dynamically create the "fast version" of the table.
 
 You can then use this table to make your state machine run.
